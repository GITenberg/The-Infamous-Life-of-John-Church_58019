LIFE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
<i>JOHN CHURCH</i>,<br />
&amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been justly remarked, by a
celebrated writer, that &ldquo;a sudden rise from a low station,
as it sometimes shews to advantage the virtuous and amiable
qualities, which could not exert themselves before, so it more
frequently calls forth and exposes to view those spots of the
soul which lay lurking in secret, cramped by penury, and veiled
with dissimulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Church</span>, the subject of the
following pages, was found, when an infant, on the steps, or near
the porch of a church (some say that of St. Andrew, in Holborn;)
and the overseers of the parish not being able to discover who
were his parents, or by whom he was thus abandoned, had him sent
to the Foundling Hospital, where he received that name, which
bears the nearest analogy to the place where he was found.&nbsp;
Here he remained until he was nine years old, when a complaint to
the Governors having been made against him by the nurses, that he
was addicted to improper and disgusting practices, it was thought
prudent to apprentice him out at that early age, to obviate the
possibility of the contagion spreading amongst the rest of the
boys who partook of the bounties of that charity.&nbsp; From his
evident illiteracy, and from the badness of his writing, it is
certain that he must have quitted the Hospital at an earlier age
than usual, because, in general, none leave it who are not good
scholars.&nbsp; He was accordingly placed out as an apprentice to
a Gilder, in Blackfriars Road.&nbsp; Before the expiration of his
indenture, he married and quitted the service of his
master.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, he worked for a composition
ornament maker, in Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; This immaculate
Minister of the Gospel here commenced his religious career, and,
under the assumed garb of sanctity, took upon him the office of a
teacher to the Sunday School, at that time established at
Tottenham Court Chapel.&nbsp; Thinking that preaching was a
better trade than that which he was employed in, this
<i>precious</i> teacher, together with two other young men, hired
a garret in the neighbourhood of Soho, where they used to learn
the method of addressing themselves to a congregation.&nbsp; An
old chair was the substitute for a pulpit.&nbsp; <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>He now began
(to use his own expression) &ldquo;<i>to gammon the old
women</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Good fortune happened at length to
procure him the notice of Old Mother Barr, of Orange-street, who,
being interested in his behalf, allowed him the use of a room of
hers, in which he treated her and a few other choice labourers in
the field of piety with his rapturous discourses..&nbsp; From
this he used to hold forth more publicly.&nbsp; His virtues and
acquirements now recommended him to one Garrett, of notorious
memory, who obtained him a <i>living</i> at Banbury.&nbsp; It was
at this place that he became obnoxious.&nbsp; Having made several
violent attempts upon some young men while at that place, he was
driven out from thence, by the trustees of the chapel in which he
preached, and ordered never to show his face there again.&nbsp;
He hastily decamped, leaving behind him his wife and children;
and the police officers having been sent in pursuit, their
searches proved fruitless, and it was a long time before he was
heard of.&nbsp; He once more retired into the country, but was
called from his solitude, to use his influence in town, by a man
of his own disgraceful kind, named <i>Kitty Cambric</i>, and well
know at the Swan, in <i>Vere Street</i>.&nbsp; It is proper to
observe here that some of these wretches assume the names of
women, and that they are absolutely married together, as will be
shown presently, from Church&rsquo;s having been the parson who
performed the blasphemous mock ceremony of joining them in the
ties of &ldquo;<i>Holy Matrimony</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now settled
himself at Chapel Court, in the Borough, when his old friend
Garrett, publicly charged him with a wicked and diabolical
offence, as the law says, &ldquo;not to be named amongst
Christians,&rdquo; and he was obliged to run away from this
accusation.&nbsp; By some fortuitous event he at length got
possession of the Obelisk Chapel, where he began to deliver his
doctrines to those who were foolish and ignorant enough to attend
to his fulsome and incoherent exclamations.&nbsp; Several young
men, whose names are known to the writer, who were accustomed to
hear him, were obliged to leave him in consequence of his having
used them in a manner too indecent to be mentioned or hinted
at.&nbsp; E. B. a respectable tradesman, residing in the Borough
of Southwark, has informed the writer of the present article,
that this parson, or rather this monster, when be was about to
preach, would frequently say&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I am going to tip
&rsquo;em a gammoning story; my old women would believe the moon
to be made of green cheese if I was to tell them so; and I must
tell them something.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer has also been
informed, from credible authority, that Church was a constant
attendant in Vere-street, and that the gang of miscreants who met
at the public-house there, some of whom stood in the pillory
about seven or eight years ago, had nominated him to be their
<i>Chaplain</i>, and that he officiated in that capacity.&nbsp;
By virtue of his functions in this situation, he was often
employed in joining these monsters in the &ldquo;indissoluble tie
of matrimony!!!&rdquo;&nbsp; They were absolutely wedded
together.&nbsp; One evening, when Church visited this infamous
place of resort, one of the gang observed, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
Parson Church.&nbsp; Aye, Parson, how d&rsquo;ye do?&nbsp; Have
you come to see our Chapel?&rdquo;&mdash;Church replied,
&ldquo;Yes, and to preach too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the above account is the following,
communicated by the before-mentioned E. B. who happened,
unfortunately, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>to be an attendant at Church&rsquo;s meeting house, when
the latter took notice of and formed an acquaintance with him,
commencing as usual with pious exhortations, and then followed up
by distrusting freedoms.&nbsp; Mr. B. however, struck with horror
at such conduct, abandoned the place, when he received two
letters from Church, of which the following are
copies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Ned</span>&mdash;May the
best of blessings be yours in life and in death, while the sweet
sensations of real genuine disinterested friendship rules every
power of your mind body and soul.&nbsp; I can only say I wish you
was as much captivated with sincere friendship as I am but we all
know our own feelings best&mdash;Friendship those best of names,
affection those sweetest power like some powerful charm that
overcomes the mind&mdash;I could write much on this subject but I
dare not trust you with what I could say much as I esteem
you&mdash;You would consider it as unmanly and quite effeminate,
and having already proved what human nature is I must conceal
even those emotions of love which I feel.&nbsp; I wish I had the
honor of being loved by you as much and in as great a degree as I
do you.&nbsp; Sometimes the painful thought of a separation
overpowers me, many are now trying at it but last night I told
the persons that called on me that let them insinuate what they
would I would never sacrifice my dear Ned to the shrine of any
other friend upon earth&mdash;and that them who did not like him,
should have none of my company at all.&nbsp; I find dear Ned many
are using all their power to part us but I hope it will prove in
vain on your side the effect that all this has upon me is to make
me love you ten times more than ever, I wish opposition may have
the same effect upon you in this particular but I fear not.
however I am confident if you love me now or at any other time my
heart will ever be set upon you nor can I ever forget you till
death.&nbsp; Your leaving of me will break my heart, bring down
my poor mind with sorrow to the grave and wring from my eyes the
briny tears, while my busy meddling memory will call to
remembrance the few pleasant hours we spent together.&nbsp; I
picture to my imagination the affecting scene the painful
thought, I must close the affecting subject &rsquo;tis more than
my feelings are able to bear&mdash;My heart is full, my mind is
sunk, I shall be better when I have vented out my grief.&nbsp;
Stand fast my dearest Ned to me I shall to you whether you do to
me or no, and may we be pardoned, justified, and brought more to
the knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; O help me to sing&mdash;</p>
<p>When thou my righteous Judge shall come<br />
To fetch thy ransom&rsquo;d people home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May I among them stand,<br />
Let such a worthless worm as I,<br />
That sometimes am afraid to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be found at thy right hand.<br />
I love to meet amongst them now,<br />
Before thy gracious feet to bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; vilest of them all;<br />
But can I bear the piercing thought,<br />
What if my name should be left out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou for them should call.</p>
<p>Learn these two verses by heart and then I will write two
more, as they are expressions of mind fears sensations and
desires&mdash;I must close, I long to see your dear face again, I
long for Sunday morning till then God bless you.</p>
<p>3d March, 1809.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain unalterably thy dear thy
loving friend,<br />
J. CHURCH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
following, without a date, was written by Church to Mr. B. who
received it on or about the 15th day of March, 1809:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Is this
thy kindness to thy once professed much loved friend, surely I
never, never did deserve such cruel treatment at your hands; why
not speak to me last night in James-street when you heard me
call, Stop! stop! Ned! do, pray do: but cruel, cruel Ned, deaf to
all intreaties&mdash;O why was I permitted to pass the door of
Mr. Gibbons when you and West were coming out.&nbsp; Why was I
permitted to tramp up and down the New Cut after you; I wanted to
speak one bitter heart breaking painful distressing word,
farewell: I only wanted to pour my sorrows into your bosom, to
shake hands with you once more, but I was denied this
indulgence.&nbsp; I never, never thought you would deceive
me&mdash;O what an unhappy man am I; the thing that I most feared
is come upon me, no excuse can justify such apparent duplicity; O
my distress is great indeed.&nbsp; O my God! what shall I
do?&nbsp; O Christ!&nbsp; O God! support me in this trying hour,
what a night am I passing through; I cannot sleep, its near three
o&rsquo;clock; alas! sleep is departed, how great my grief, how
bitter my sorrows, the loss of my character is nothing to the
loss of one dearer to me than any thing else.&nbsp; O let me give
vent to tears; but I am too, too much distressed to cry; O that I
could.&nbsp; I feel this like a dagger; never, never can I
forgive the unhappy instrument of my distress in
Charlotte-street.&nbsp; Why did my dear friend Edward deceive
me?&nbsp; O how my mind was eased on Wednesday night; alas, how
distressed on Thursday.&nbsp; I have lost my only bosom friend,
nearest dearest friend, bosom from bosom torn, how horrid.&nbsp;
Ah, dear Suffolk-court, never surely can I see you again.&nbsp;
How the Philistines will triumph; there, so would we have it: how
Ebeir, Calvin, Thompson, Edwards, Bridgman, all will rejoice, and
I have lost my friend, my all in this world, except the other
part of myself, my wife, and poor babes; never did I expect this
from my dear E&mdash; B&mdash;.&nbsp; O for a clam mind, that I
might sleep till day light; but no, this I fear will be denied
me.&nbsp; How can I bear the piercing thought, parted; a dreadful
word, worst of sensations, the only indulgence, the only
confident, the only faithful, the only kind and indulgent
sympathising friend, to lose you.&nbsp; O what a stroke; O what a
cut, what shall I do for matter on Sunday; O that I could get
some one to preach for me, how can I lift up my head.&nbsp; O
Sir, if you have a grain of affection left for me, do intreat of
God to support me; this is a worse affliction than the loss of my
character nine months ago.&nbsp; A man cannot lose his character
twice.&nbsp; O I did think you knew better: I did think I had
found one in you that I could not find elsewhere; but no, the
first object presented to you, seen suddenly, gained your mind,
gained your affections; and I, poor unhappy distressed I, am left
to deplore your loss.&nbsp; O for submission, but I am
distressed; woe is me.&nbsp; O that I had never, never known you,
then I should never feel what I do; but I thank you for your
company hitherto, I have enjoyed it four moths exactly, but this
is over for ever; miserable as I am, I wish you well for ever,
for ever.&nbsp; I write in the bitterness of my soul which I
feel.&nbsp; May you never be cursed with the feelings I possess
as long as you live.&nbsp; What a day I have before me; I cannot
go out of my house till Sunday morning.&nbsp; How can I conceal
my grief from my dear wife? how shall I hide it? what shall I
say?&nbsp; I am miserable, nor can I surmount the shock at
all.&nbsp; I have no friend to pour out my sorrows to now, I wish
I had; I am sorry you are so easily duped by any to answer their
purposes; my paper is full, my <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>paper is full, my heart is worse; God
help me; Lord God support me! what shall I do, dear God!&nbsp; O
Lord! have mercy on me, I must close; this comes from your ever
loving but distressed</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For some years past, the person just named has been getting a
living by preaching as a Minister of the Gospel in an obscure
conventicle close to the Surrey Theatre.&nbsp; In the mean time,
reports had gone abroad that he was addicted to certain
abominable propensities; and certain gentlemen in the
neighbourhood, not actuated by any jealousy towards a successful
&ldquo;rival in the vineyard,&rdquo; but dreading the disgrace
and pollution which Christianity might suffer from the immoral
character of any of its teachers, investigated these rumours; and
the facts now related came to light.&nbsp; James Cook, who kept
the infamous house in Vere Street, was released from his two
years imprisonment in Newgate, on the 21st of September
1812.&nbsp; In the course of a few days after, he accidentally
met John Church, and recognized him as the <i>gay parson</i> whom
he had formerly seen at a certain house in the London Road, and
at his own house in Vere Street.&nbsp; A friendly correspondence
then took place between these two old acquaintances.&nbsp; About
the 13th of October, Cook received a letter from him.&nbsp; In
this the <i>Minister of the Gospel</i> offers his assistance to
the &ldquo;Vere Street Culprit,&rdquo; to enable him to set up
another public house, as the reader will perceive from perusing
the letter itself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Lest I should not have time to call on you or converse with
you at I shall not be alone to Day I thought it But right to Drop
you a Line I wish you all the success you can desire in getting a
house fit for the Business in the public Line as you had a great
many acquaintance, they ought not to fail you if every one acted
right according to there ability I am sure you would soon
accomplish it.&nbsp; As I am by no means Rich, But rather
embarrassed I hope you will accept my mite towards it 1l. 1s. and
you shall have another as convenient wishing you all
prosperity.</p>
<p>I remain Your&rsquo;s, sincerely.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. CHURCH.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">for Mr. Cook, at mr.&nbsp; Halladays
Richmond Budgs. Dean St.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another letter bearing the two-penny post nark of the
20th of October.&mdash;It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I received your note this morning in Bed, as I have contracted
such a Dreadful cold Being wet on Tuesday I am very much grieved
i have not been able to comply with the request concerning Mr.
C&mdash; But I shall certainly keep my eye upon him and Do him
all the Good it lays in my power where ever he is he knows my
Disposition too well to impute any remissness to my conduct But I
cannot do impossibilities as I have Lately had and have now Got
so many Distressing cases in hand Beside, I will Be sure to call
on you as soon as I can&mdash;But am not able to day</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain Yours.&nbsp; J CHURCH.</p>

Richmond&rsquo;s buildings, Dean Street, Soho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The next
document it a letter dated March 7, 1810, from a person at
Banbury named Hall, of which the following is a copy:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>&mdash;In
reply to your letter concerning Mr. C. I can only inform you,
there was a report against him of a very scandalous nature; but
how far his culpability extends, it is quite out of my power to
determine.&nbsp; He was absent from hence when the rumour first
spread.&nbsp; The Managers of our Chapel took great pains to
enquire into the origin of such reports, and the result was, they
sent Mr. C. positive orders, never, on any account, to return to
Banbury again; which advice he has hitherto wisely
observed.&nbsp; Now, Sir, after giving you the above information,
I beg leave to conclude the subject, by referring you to your own
comment hereon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) S. <span
class="smcap">Hall</span>.</p>
<p><i>Banbury</i>, <i>March</i> 7, 1810.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a letter from Wm. Clarke of Ipswich, a young man
between 19 and 20 years of age, which contains an account of
attempts too horrid to be published.&nbsp; The written confession
(frightful indeed it is) of this poor simple young man, whose
mind was bewildered by the canting exhortations of Church; and
the whole of his statements corroborated by the oral testimony of
Mr. Wire, who resides at Colchester, and knows Clarke very
well.&nbsp; The circumstances related by Clarke would have
furnished ample grounds for a criminal prosecution had he made
his complaint <i>immediately</i> after the <i>assault</i> was
committed:&mdash;but suffering under the influence of ignorance
and fear, he kept it a secret too long, and afterwards accepted
of a pound note from Church.&nbsp; A case was laid before two
eminent barristers, to have their opinion whether such a
prosecution could be carried on with any prospect of
conviction.&nbsp; Their opinion, in writing, is, that after the
long concealment of a Charge, a Jury would pay no attention to
his evidence, unless he was confirmed in his story by other
evidence.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Extract from the
Confession of Wm. Clark</i>, <i>of Ipswich</i>.</p>
<p>Having been called by Providence to Colchester, I went to hear
John Church preach in a barn, was invited to Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s;
was prevailed upon to sleep with John Church; I did sleep with
him three nights; after being enticed to many imprudencies, I was
under the necessity to resist certain attempts, which, if I had
complied with, I am fearful must have ruined both soul and body;
the crime is too horrid to relate.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;This took place in March last, 1812.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The peace of this poor lad&rsquo;s mind however is completely
destroyed, so fatally has the event preyed upon him;&mdash;so far
so as to fill the bosom of his aged father with such a spirit of
indignation and revenge, that he actually came up to London with
a full determination to be the death of him who had thus ruined
the peace of his beloved son, while the mother&rsquo;s mind was
not less distracted than that of the father.&nbsp; In consequence
of this, the father entered J. Church&rsquo;s meeting house, with
two loaded pistols, one in each pocket; but under the excess of
agitation, he fainted away, and was carried out of the place.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The
following will cast some light on the preceding:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Colchester</i>,
<i>September</i> 16, 1812.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Last evening I had an
interview with Clark&rsquo;s father, who wishes him to comply
with your wishes.&nbsp; I mentioned to him respecting
Church&rsquo;s conduct, and I find the last night to be the
worst.&nbsp; Likewise that he would have committed the act had
not Clark prevented him.&nbsp; The particulars I told you when in
London, but find them worse than what I described to you.&nbsp;
They are not able to be at any expence; but if the Gentlemen wish
to prosecute, and to pay Clark&rsquo;s expences up to London,

<p>The following is a narrative which Cook has given of his
acquaintance with <i>Parson Church</i>; and which was taken down
from his own dictation by Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash;:</p>
<blockquote><p>In May, 1810, I was in company with Mr. Yardley
and another young man by the name of Ponder.&nbsp; I found after
that the said Ponder was a drummer in the Guards; I called at a
house in the London Road, where I saw Mr. Church the first time
in my life: there was at this house about twelve or fourteen
altogether, drinking gin, and Mr. Church handed me a glass of the
same, which I took; Church behaved very polite to me, and said
what a fine fellow I was; he pressed me very much to stop and get
tea with them, for he said he would call and see me when I was
settled in the house in Vere-street.&nbsp; I stopped a little
while, and was about to leave them, when Church said I should not
go before I had tea, and flung down a dollar; and a man, by the
name of Gaiscoin, took the money and went for the tea and other
things, but I would not stay: Church came out of the room with
me, and walked with me as far as the turnpike; there he met
another gentleman, which I never saw before, and I went on and
left him for that time; I think it was six or eight days.&nbsp; I
went to live at the Swan, and saw Church again; he came about
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and Mr. Yardley accosted
him, &ldquo;Parson, what! are you come to see the
chapel?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said &ldquo;Yes, and to preach
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Church asked me how I was; I said I was not
very well: he asked me why I went away in that shy manner; I told
him he was a stranger to me, and I did not like to be intruding
on strange people: he said I was shy&mdash;he did not know what
to make of me; he also pressed me very much to take a walk with
him, but I declined it: he said I must go, but I still declined,
and did not go with him: he staid some time, and joined the
company in the back parlour&mdash;persons by the name of Miss Fox
and Miss Kitty Cambrick was among them, and the Queen of
Bohemia.&nbsp; As Mr. C. was going away, he came to the bar and
spoke to me, and said I must take something to drink, which I
did, and he paid for it, and left the house for that time, in a
few days he called again, in the afternoon, and there was not
many people there; he asked if Yardley was at home; I said he was
not: he said he was very sorry for it: I asked him what he
wanted; he said he came on purpose for me to take a walk with
him, but I did not go: he said he would wait until Yardley came
in.&nbsp; Church said I should do him a great favour if I would
take a walk with him; I would not go&mdash;he still pressed me
very much to go: I said I would if he would wait till I had
cleaned myself: he waited more than two hours for me; I went to
sleep because I would not go with him; and in the mean time he
waited so long that he was tired; he sent the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>waiter to
call me, which he did, and said the Parson wanted me, and had
been waiting two hours for me; I said, let him wait, for I should
not come; he returned, and said if I would but speak to him, he
should go away happy: I found I could not get rid of him&mdash;I
went down stairs; he said, well, sir, I hope your nap has done
you good; I said, I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t bother
me.&nbsp; He said I was very cross to him; I told him there was
other men without me; if he wanted to preach, not to preach to me
about crossness.&nbsp; He said, well, if that was the case, he
was very sorry he had offended me; I told him he had not offended
me nor pleased me; but as I was not well, the less any one talked
to me the better I liked it; he said, if I was but friends with
him, and shake hands with him, he should go away happy.&nbsp; Mr.
Yardley said he never see such a fellow as I was, for I had
affronted every body that came to the house.&nbsp; I then shook
hands with the Parson, for at that time I did not know his
name.&nbsp; He shook hands with me, and we had something to
drink, and Mr. Church paid for it and went away.&nbsp; I never
saw him until I came out of Newgate; I was talking to Mr. and
Mrs. Holloway, and telling them there was a Parson somewhere
about St. George&rsquo;s Fields, but his name I did not
know.&nbsp; He asked me if I should know him if I saw him, I said
I should; by that I went to the Chapel and saw Mr. Church, and
then I asked the people what was the Parson&rsquo;s name; they
told me his name was Church.&nbsp; I said he ought to be ashamed
of himself to preach there, a *** and rascal, and left the place,
and went home in the greatest pains I ever felt in my life, and
was resolved to see him, which I did the next day, and give him
one of the hand-bills; and the manner he received me, was like a
young man would his sweetheart;&mdash;I begun my conversation:
Well, Sir, I suppose you do not know me?&nbsp; He said he did
not.&nbsp; I said my name was Cook, that kept the Swan, in
Vere-street.&nbsp; He said he thought so, but was not sure: he
said, why did I not call before and shake hands with
a-body.&nbsp; I told him I did not know where he lived, nor I did
not know his name until I went to the chapel and found him
out.&nbsp; He told me not to make it known that he ever came to
my house, for he and Rowland Hill had daggers drawn, and that he
should be obliged to indite Hill to clear up his character, and
for God&rsquo;s sake do not expose me.&mdash;(<i>Here the
narrative breaks off</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are various other documents which are too voluminous to
notice at present.&nbsp; The point to direct the attention of the
public is, the extraordinary circumstance of a man continuing to
exercise the functions of a christian pastor up to the present
time, with such heavy imputations as these hanging over his
head.&nbsp; He knew that the whole neighbourhood rung with
accusations; he knew that some hundreds of publications
containing charges so severe, that any statements compared to
them, &ldquo;were lenity and compassion,&rdquo; have been sold in
St. George&rsquo;s-fields.</p>
<p>The reader may probably have some curiosity to know what sort
of a preacher this person is.&nbsp; I have gone to hear him; and
I pity his poor deluded followers.&nbsp; He does indeed deliver
himself in a full, clear, articulate tone of voice; but to
criticise his style, or analyse the <i>substance</i> of his
discourse, would be a fruitless labour: it would be like
dissecting a cobweb.&nbsp; Unmeaning rhapsodies, and unconnected
sentences, through which the faintest gleam of morality is not to
be traced, must, from their evanescent nature, set the powers of
recollection at defiance; they even escape from the lash of
one&rsquo;s contempt.&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>In his countenance there is none of
that dignified mildness, none of that subdued expression of piety
which one often observes in Christian preachers whose habits of
life are conformable to their precepts.&nbsp; His manner is
forward and imposing; and his eyes are continually employed in
staring at some person among his auditors. <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>The following Character is given of Church by Mr. George Gee
and his wife, who live in the New Cut, Lambeth Marsh.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Church the Minister lodged at our house
a year and a half, and left last year at Lady-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in hopes that we were about to have a godly
praying minister in our house, and to be sure, the first night he
had somewhat like prayer, and that and once afterwards, were the
only times he ever went to family prayer in our house.&nbsp; Nor
could they have any prayer, as he would be frequently out almost
all hours of the night, and would lie in bed till ten
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Several times he and his wife
would have skirmishings and fightings between themselves, while
their children would be left to run about the streets out of
school hours, and allowed to keep company with children that
would swear in our hearing most shockingly.&nbsp; His children
were always left to be very dirty, and would be sent sometimes
three or four times in the morning for spirituous liquors of all
sorts; as for reading good books or even the Bible, he scarce
ever thought of it, but would spend a deal of his time in loose
and vain talk, in walking about, and in fawning on young men,
that was his chief delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sundays and working days were all alike to them, for
they would send out to buy liquors and whatever else they wanted,
on Sundays as well as other days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house would be frequently more like a play-house (I
might say a bawdy house) than a minister&rsquo;s house, where a
set of young people would come, and behave more indecently than
ought to be mentioned.&nbsp; Even one Sunday morning they made
such an uproar, as that they broke one of the windows, and after
that, they would go with him to his Chapel, and after that he
would give the sacrament to such disorderly people, let their
characters be ever so loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always ready to go fast enough out to dinner or
supper, where he could get good eating and drinking; but poor
people might send to him from their sick bed, times and times
before he would come to them.&nbsp; Seeing so much of his
inconsistencies and shocking filthiness in their rooms, (though
they always paid the rent,) we were determined to give them
warning to quit our house, and we do think that a worse man or
woman never came into any man&rsquo;s house before, especially as
Mr. Church pretended to preach the gospel; such hypocrites are
much worse than others, and besides this, we never heard any man
tell lies so fast in all our lives.&nbsp; It is a great grief to
us that ever we went to hear him preach, or suffered him to stop
so long in our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;GEORGE <span
class="GutSmall">AND</span> FRANCES GEE.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>In
addition to the above testimonies, the writer has received a very
long narrative of atrocities committed by <span
class="smcap">John Church</span> while he resided at Banbury,
written by a Minister at that place; but the facts are too
disgusting and shocking to be published.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the 6th of June 1813, the Grand Jury for the County of
Middlesex found a Bill of Indictment against <span
class="smcap">John Church</span> for his attempt some years ago
on a lad named Webster.&nbsp; Incredible as it may appear, this
very man, on the very evening of the day he was held to bail for
trial on the most horrid charges, given on oath, had the
impudence to go into his chapel and preach to a crowded
audience.</p>
<p>At the Middlesex Sessions on Monday the 12th of July 1813, he
was tried and <i>acquitted</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, it was never
imagined that any other verdict than one of acquittal would have
been given.&nbsp; If the reader looks back to the proceedings at
Union Hall, he will find that this prosecution was <span
class="GutSmall">ORDERED</span> by the Magistrates of that
Office, <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>and <i>did not originate</i> with the prosecutor,
William Webster, on whom the abominable attempt was alleged to
have been made (now fourteen years ago).&nbsp; The very mention
of the attempt was a mere incidental circumstance arising out of
another proceeding then before the Magistrates.&nbsp; Let the
Reader also take notice of the following
sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;The Magistrate observed, that from the
length of time which had elapsed since the offence had been
committed, he thought a Jury would not feel justified in finding
him guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; This William Webster, therefore, must be
considered, in all respects, as an unwilling prosecutor.&nbsp; He
was supported only by one counsel, then of young standing (Mr.
Adolphus), who had to struggle against two of the most able
advocates (Messrs. Gurney and Alley) in the criminal
courts.&nbsp; It appears also that Webster gave his evidence with
embarrassment and trepidation, and that he suffered himself to
fall into some inconsistencies.&nbsp; With this <i>solitary</i>
and confused evidence, and after a lapse&mdash;after a
<i>silence</i> of <span class="GutSmall">ELEVEN YEARS</span>, was
it possible to suppose that a Jury would have found any man
guilty?&nbsp; It must here be observed, that the decision on this
solitary complaint of eleven years standing, does not in the
slightest degree affect any of the numerous accusations of a more
recent date which have been made against John Church.</p>

<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Several persons have been at a loss to know by what authority
this man presumed to take upon himself the functions of a
Minister of the Gospel.&nbsp; They have asked how could a man so
profligate&mdash;so notoriously criminal, come forth to instruct
others in religion.&nbsp; The question is natural, and demands an
answer.&nbsp; The practice among Dissenters is, that when any man
feels a strong desire to become a preacher, he communicates the
same to several Ministers, who make strict enquiry into his
qualifications as to piety, learning, morals, &amp;c. and if they
find these established on satisfactory evidence, they then confer
on the candidate a sort of ordination, without which he can have
no authority to officiate as a minister of the Gospel.&nbsp; It
seems, that Church did receive some ordination of this kind at
the town of Banbury, in Oxfordshire, from which place he was
driven away for his mal-practices.&nbsp; Since then he has not
been, under the controul, and has acted in defiance of all the
ordinances of the Dissenting Church.&nbsp; He has in fact gone
about as a mere isolated adventurer; and no minister would preach
in a pulpit belonging to him.&nbsp; Yet he continued to preach,
in defiance of Christian as well as moral ordinances, because he
could not be silenced by any legal authority, and because he
rejected all ecclesiastical government.</p>
<p>One character peculiar to the person we are speaking of is,
that wherever he has been admitted as a preacher, he has
disturbed the religious system, and upset the order of the
place.&nbsp; In Colchester he turned the whole congregation
against their minister, by preaching doctrines tending to
encourage licentiousness and to foster the worst passions.&nbsp;
All persons acquainted with history will recollect, that this
mode of healing the consciences of profligate men was practised
by the Romish Church before the Reformation, and when it
flourished in its rankest state of corruption&mdash;when
indulgences for sins to be committed, and pardon for sins past,
were openly sold for money.&nbsp; The manner in which the Obelisk
Preacher has conducted the affairs of his <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>chapel bears
some resemblance to this practice; and for the purpose of
increasing his revenue, he has even administered the sacrament to
persons when intoxicated!!</p>
<p>However great may be the mass of folly, ignorance, and
fanaticism, which prevail throughout most of the low conventicles
of this metropolis, and however injuriously they may operate on
the human mind, their effects are innocence and virtue, compared
to the influence of that guilt which has so recently been
exposed; and it is not too much to observe that the poor silly
visionaries who deal in pictures, in miracles, and monstrous
conceits, are not wilfully or practically vicious, and that they
have <i>lashed</i> themselves into a belief of what they preach;
therefore they cannot drag forward so close upon the heels of Mr.
John Church as to hold out an appearance of their belonging to
the same society.&nbsp; After Church having been held to bail for
the purpose of being tried on charges not to be named among
Christians, he ought to have abstained from entering his pulpit,
and shunned the very light, until his character was cleared up to
the satisfaction of his congregation, who ought to have deemed it
a sacrilege to be present while he attempted to promulgate the
doctrines of Christ in a place of divine worship.&nbsp; But one
would think there was a congeniality of sentiment and of
<i>sympathy</i> between the pastor and the flock!&nbsp; Indeed
this latter remark is founded upon something more than
conjecture; for a great number of persons who are in the habit of
frequenting his chapel, have taken up the cause of their preacher
with a zeal that cannot easily be accounted for in any way but
one.&nbsp; They will investigate no charge; they reject all
evidence.</p>

<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following Confessional Letter, from Church, was sent to
the great surprise of the Rev. Mr. L&mdash;, two days after the
offence had been committed.&nbsp; It appears that Church was but
very slightly known to the above gentleman, in consequence of
some money transactions having passed between them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Surely
upon the reception of this short note you will say, ah.&nbsp;
<i>Church</i> is like all the rest of the parsons, promise much
and do little, yea nothing: to your note I can only with a pained
heart reply, <i>I cannot indeed</i>&mdash;I can scarcely write
this note, my soul is too deeply pierced.&nbsp; About eight or
nine years ago Dr. Draper left the church in the Boro&rsquo;, and
God opened Chaple court for me, many attended and have been
blest, now a singular providence but a most distressing one has
occurred to take me shortly from my dear, dear family and beloved
congregation.&nbsp; But God has sent Mr. L&mdash; to preach all
the truth to my poor dispersed flock, at least so it appears to
me, and I would do all the good to promote the success of Mr.
L&mdash; that my poor people might <i>not</i> be starv&rsquo;d
till I return to them in peace, which may be many months.&nbsp;
My heart is broken, my enemies have ruined me at last, and I
shall never, never surmount it, an unpleasant affair happening at
Vauxhall, is <i>added</i> too, and I must take the consequences:
no arm can help, relieve, or deliver but the Lord&rsquo;s, and I
feel persuaded the Lord will <i>not</i>: judge my feelings if you
can.&nbsp; I shall secretly come and hear you, to get all the
good I can to an heart deprest, disconsolate, and full of
woe.&nbsp; O the joy of my enemies!&nbsp; O the distress of my
friends!&nbsp; O my poor heart!&nbsp; Let a sigh go up to God for
me when you can.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours in the utmost distress,<br />
J. C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
following are the remarks of the Gentleman to whom the above
Letter was addressed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A self-sent divine and a beloved brother of the
Reverend J. Church, whose name is T. A&mdash;, positively
declared&mdash;(but a few weeks ago) that the very affectionate
<i>Vere-street</i> &ldquo;Mr. Church kindly put his arms round my
neck and kissed me twice, and asked me politely to sleep with
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord, what has sin done!&nbsp; However the
Reverend brother T. A. further adds, &ldquo;I declined the latter
offer, of course,&rdquo; &amp;c. but how far this statement may
be true respecting his declining the latter offer, after his
allowing that pious brute to kiss him twice, must be left with
the reader to judge for himself, as I am confident that none but
those <i>unclean birds</i>, of the <i>same nest</i>, would in any
measure wish even the slightest credit to be given to such a
filthy testimony, by such an <i>effeminate</i> character as T.
A.&nbsp; Again, this brother in iniquity, when speaking of
another brother, in the same line of uncleanness, whose name I
understand is C&mdash;, who is a person very remarkable for using
the words, (when speaking of his darling Church) &ldquo;<i>bless
him</i>,&rdquo; being informed by his brother A. that brother
Church was about to leave town, in order to evade further
inquiries, the poor thing (<i>woman-like</i>) fainted and fell
back against a wall; but his brother A. being near him, kindly
took him by the hand and raised his drooping head (<i>dear
lamb</i>), who, when he had a little recovered the shock, they
affectionately walked off together, and the fainting brother took
hold of his brother A.&rsquo;s hand, (&ldquo;bless him,&rdquo;)
rubbed it affectionately, and pressed it to his bosom, wishing to
have a further intercourse with him!&nbsp; Marvellous wickedness!
may it not truly be said of such detestable monsters, in human
shape, that God has given them over to vile affections and to all
uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour
their own bodies between themselves.&nbsp; Burning in their own
lust one towards another, men with men, working that which is
unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their
error which is meet.&nbsp; How truly awful and equally disgusting
that such vile wretches should be permitted to stand up with a
pretence to preach the Gospel, or that they should even profess
to be believers in Jesus, as without all doubt the sin of which
they stand justly charged, was invented by the arch fiend of
Hell, to prevent the appearance of the seed of the woman, <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> who was to effectually bruize his
head.&nbsp; O! my soul, come not thou into their diabolical
secret!&nbsp; I would advise all the true followers of the meek
and lowly Lamb of God, who may hitherto have been deceived as to
the real character of Church and his brothers who worship with
him at the Surrey Tabernacle, in the language of the Angel to
Lot&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Haste, escape for thy life,
tarry not in all the plain.&rdquo;&mdash;See Gen. xix. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great credit is due to Mr. Patrick for the perseverance he has
manifested in bringing this hypocritical wretch to justice.&nbsp;
Unmindful of the threats and abuse of a party, and not to be
deterred by the heavy expences attending such a prosecution, he
has, at length, finally triumphed over all the arts and intrigues
that had been practised <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>against his obtaining the desirable
end, namely, in tearing off the mask from this <i>pretended
pious</i> preacher, and rendering him amenable to the offended
laws of his country.</p>
<p>It may not be improper to state one of the tricks made use of
to throw the prosecutor off his guard.&nbsp; A limb of the law it
appears, of the <i>Jewish</i> persuasion, <i>gratuitously</i>
offered to conduct the prosecution for the young man; but upon a
refusal being given to him, on account of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Harmer</span> being selected for such purpose, it
was ultimately discovered that this <i>philanthropic</i>
Israelite had been exerting himself towards exculpating Church,
with all the ingenuity he was master of in his defence, from the
heinous offence alledged against him.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;law&rsquo;s delay&rdquo; was resorted to, but only to put
off the trial till the next assizes, but the expences materially
increased, as a means of deterring the prosecutor from
proceeding.&nbsp; It is however lamentable to observe, that the
charges in bringing such a wretch to justice, should amount to
eighty or ninety pounds!</p>
<p>The wife of Church, upon being made acquainted with his
diabolical propensities, became distracted, and was in a
continual state of intoxication, till death relieved this
unfortunate woman from her troubles.&nbsp; But it appears that
since he has been charged with the above detestable offence, in
order (we presume under the mask of hypocrisy,) to rescue in some
degree his character from the public odium with which it had been
marked, induced him to marry a respectable woman, who kept a
seminary for young ladies at Hammersmith.&nbsp; The verdict of
&ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; had been scarcely pronounced, when the
relatives of the children, with the greatest promptitude
possible, took them all away from the said school.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above confessional letter, (see page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page14">14</a></span>,) for the
authenticity of which we can vouch, having the original in our
possession, on the Sunday after it was sent, he had the audacity
and wickedness to stand up in his pulpit, and endeavour to
calumniate his accusers and assert his own innocence; but this
effrontery, it seems, has at length left him, since the verdict
of twelve impartial men have pronounced him guilty, that on
Sunday last (Aug. 17.) he had not the temerity again to face the
numerous audience that had assembled both within and without the
walls of his chapel.</p>
<p>From the acknowledgment of this monster himself, the profits
of this <i>precious</i> recepticle produced him from
1000<i>l.</i> to 1200<i>l.</i> annually.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote11"></a><a href="#citation11"
class="footnote">[11]</a>&nbsp; A Gentleman who happened to
attend two or three times at Church&rsquo;s Meeting-house, took
down the following sentences from his Sermons.&nbsp; They may
gratify the curiosity of the reader.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is frequently going forth, and we also
are often going to the window to look for him; The more vile <i>I
am</i> made to appear to the <i>World</i>, the more God will
<i>assist</i> me.&nbsp; Every citizen is a free-born.&nbsp; Many
have wondered how I could go thro&rsquo; so much trouble.&nbsp;
There have been a great many that have wished to see me&mdash;I
can inform them I had much rather they had wished to see
Christ.&nbsp; People may be laughed at for being fools, but you
may depend upon it the more God will like them.&nbsp; All that
believe not will certainly be damned.&nbsp; The duties of
Christianity are not to be preached to an ungodly world; John
Church is very much spoken of, but they had much better speak of
Jesus; the people of the established church feel no spiritual
joy.&nbsp; Spiritual discourse is enlivening to the senses,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The bread of life is not to be given away to
<i>Dogs</i>.&nbsp; I am not going to turn auctioneer, but I am
going to inform you that next Lord&rsquo;s Day I am going to
publish a book proving that God, the Son, and the Spirit, are all
one great God.&nbsp; My sermon will be good news and comfort to
all poor sinners; Satan and all his spirits never sleeps; the
power of life and death is only in the bands of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Devils are allowed to harrass the people of God day
and night&mdash;no wonder they perplex those they cant
destroy.&nbsp; People are mostly liable to fall in their first
love into awful heresies and temptation.&nbsp; All the
Lord&rsquo;s people do not see into the glory of my
text&mdash;&rsquo;tis like a jewel in a rock of Adamant.&nbsp;
The worst sin was the murdering of God&rsquo;s saints.&nbsp; When
I sit in darkness the Lord will be a light onto me.&nbsp; Many
men laugh at the doctrine of the new birth&mdash;are there not
many learned Doctors that know nothing of it?&nbsp; Let a man
come under any circumstances, I will receive
him&mdash;Don&rsquo;t laugh at the doctrine of inspiration; be
wise, it has often been preached by our church&mdash;I am never
tired of preaching; and I believe my dear brethren are never
tired of hearing me.&nbsp; If every one that is saved should be
as bright as the sun, what a place Heaven must be, where there
will be so many millions!&nbsp; Angels beckon me away, and Christ
bids me come.&nbsp; The sight of Christ, you may depend
on&rsquo;t, will be worth suffering for.&nbsp; O that I had the
voice of an archangel, I would indeed do wonders.&nbsp; I doubt
the inferiority of one angel over another in Heaven&mdash;Christ
is entirely independent of or with God.&nbsp; We must have the
spirit of God before we are his people.&nbsp; Believe in the
predestination of eternal life, but not in eternal death; people
that suffer were beforehand predestined so to do, <i>by</i>
God.&nbsp; Bad or horrid is the religion of a proud
Pharisee.&nbsp; That religion that is preached by the people of
God is God himself.&nbsp; There can be no going forth until the
spirit of God has entered.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">mob</span> is seldom stirred up but thro&rsquo;
Priests; there is now a case of the very kind.&nbsp; When envy
bursts forth thro&rsquo; jealous and envious neighbouring
<i>Priests</i>, and published by <i>Deists</i>, there can be
nothing to fear; and I verily believe, that any thing prayed for
to Christ will certainly be granted, as has always been the case
with me.&nbsp; Let us for ever endeavour to turn every thing,
whether good or bad, into good.&nbsp; I do not believe that God
begot Jesus Christ&mdash;they say too that Joseph was an impostor
at this very day:&mdash;every thing that is done against the
church is done against Christ; also that which is done against
Christ is done against the Church; and any thing done against the
people of God is done against Christ.&nbsp; It is a most blessed
thing that we can throw our burthens upon Christ;&mdash;I do not
care who hears me, whether God, or Man, Friends or Foes, Devils
or Angels, or any thing else; and let them call me an Antinomian
again if they please.&nbsp; There must be spiritual life in the
soul.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus Christ and the people of God are
one.&nbsp; Christ has no sorrow but the people of God must
sympathise with him; and the people of God have no affliction but
that Christ sympathises with them.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
